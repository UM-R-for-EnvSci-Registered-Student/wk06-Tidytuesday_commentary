# Week 06 - Tydituesday commentary assignment
This repo is intended to house all this week's commentary on #tidytuesday.

As a reminder, #TidyTuesday is a weekly twitter event organized by the [@R4DScommunity](https://twitter.com/R4DScommunity), where a dataset is made available, and then over the week, people work on that dataset. People are encouraged to produce whatever they want from the dataset. This could be a simple plot, table, or a complex analysis. They welcome people of all skills, so you will see products fitting every level, from begginers to experts.

All their data (including previous weeks) is available in their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

The data for [this week](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-10-20) (Week 43, based on the weeks of the year) will get people working with a database of previous results from the **Great American Beer Festival**.


## Your tasks

For the #Tidytuesday commentary assignments you **do not** need to analyze or work on the data. We will have a speciffic assignment about that on week 10. For now, i just want you to "watch" as the event takes place over the week. You can check Twitter as much as you want over the week. You can check for new entries daily by searching for the #TidyTuesday "hashtag", and seing what new posts appear or wait till the end of the week and browse them all. Make sure the post is about this week's dataset. Often people are trying to catch up and post about older datasets (which is ok!)

Whay I **do** want you to do: Based on your observations i will like you to open an issue (one per student) in the [issues](https://github.com/UM-R-for-EnvSci-Registered-Student/wk06-Tidytuesday_commentary/issues) section of this repo where i want you to comment on:

- Code/Tools/aproaches **we have seen in class** that you saw used ove rthe week
- Code/Tools/aproaches that you enjoyed or that surprised you that **we have not** seen in class
- Data visualizations (figures) that you enjoyed
- Data Visualization (Figures) that could be improved (and how you would improve them)

Feel free to link to the posts you are refering to.

And of course it is encouraged to read what other classmates post and comment on their posts (issues) as well.
